Lets perform an analysis to get a better understanding of the usage of the London or "Boris" bikes. Has the pandemic impacted the bike usage in 2020? lets find out!

First, lets load some libraries that are needed for our analysis.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(vroom)
library(kableExtra)
library(infer)
```


 We can get the latest bike data by running the following:

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year:
Looking at May and Jun and comparing 2020 with the previous years, we can directly see the impact of the COVID pandemic!

```{r monthly_changes, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=15}

# data preparation

expected_rentals_df <- bike %>% 
  # use years 2015-2019 as reference
  filter(year %in% 2015:2019) %>% 
  # calculate expected rentals (per day) per month over all years
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(expected_rentals = mean(bikes_hired))

excess_by_month <- bike %>% 
  # use years 2015-2019 as reference
  filter(year %in% 2015:2020) %>% 
  # calculate actual rentals for each month for every year
  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  summarise(actual_rentals = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  # join the expected rentals per month (over all years)
  left_join(expected_rentals_df, on = "month") %>% 
  # calculate excess_rentals and helper variables for the ribbon
  mutate(excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals,
         excess_rentals_pos = ifelse(excess_rentals>0, excess_rentals+expected_rentals, expected_rentals),
         excess_rentals_neg = ifelse(excess_rentals<0, excess_rentals+expected_rentals, expected_rentals))


# plot graph 1
ggplot(excess_by_month, aes(x = month)) +
  # add line for expected rentals (same for all years)
  geom_line(aes(y = expected_rentals), group = 1, size = 1, color = "blue") +
  # add black line for actual rentals 
  geom_line(aes(y = actual_rentals), group = 1, color = "black") +
  # add red and green ribbons
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = expected_rentals, ymax = excess_rentals_pos, group = 1), fill = "green4", alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = expected_rentals, ymax = excess_rentals_neg, group = 1), fill = "red3", alpha = 0.2) +
  # faceting by year
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  theme_minimal() +
  # use specific breaks
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(20000, 25000, 30000, 35000, 40000)) +
  labs(y = "Bike rentals",
       x = "",
       title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue \nand calculated between 2015-2019",
       caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), # changes size of axis labels,
        axis.title = element_text(size = 15), # changes size of axis titles,
        strip.text = element_text(size = 13), # change size of facet titles
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 15), # change size of plot subtitle
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 12), # change size of plot caption
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18)) # change size of plot title

```

Now lets look at how the weekly change in bike rental demands is impacted by the pandemic.

```{r weekly_changes, fig.height=6.5, fig.width=15}

# data preparation

expected_rentals_df_2 <- bike %>% 
  # use years 2015-2019 as reference
  filter(year %in% 2015:2019) %>% 
  # calculate expected rentals (per day) per week over all years
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(expected_rentals = mean(bikes_hired))

excess_by_week <- bike %>% 
  # use years 2015-2019 as reference
  filter(year %in% 2015:2020) %>% 
  # calculate actual rentals for each week for every year
  group_by(year, week) %>% 
  summarise(actual_rentals = mean(bikes_hired)) %>% 
  # join the expected rentals per week (over all years)
  left_join(expected_rentals_df_2, on = "week") %>% 
  # calculate excess_rentals, % change from weekly averages and helper variables for the ribbon and the rugs
  mutate(excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals,
         perc_change = excess_rentals / expected_rentals,
         perc_chane_pos = ifelse(perc_change>0, perc_change, 0),
         perc_chane_neg = ifelse(perc_change<0, perc_change, 0),
         pos_neg = factor(ifelse(perc_change > 0, 1, 0)))


# plot graph 2
ggplot(excess_by_week, aes(x = week)) +
  # add grey shaded rectangles
  geom_tile(aes(x = 19.5, width = 13, y = 0, height = Inf), alpha = 0.01, fill = "gray78") +
  # add grey shaded rectangles
  geom_tile(aes(x = 46, width = 14, y = 0, height = Inf), alpha = 0.01, fill = "gray78") +
  # add black line for percentage change
  geom_line(aes(y = perc_change), group = 1, color = "black") +
  # add rugs at the bottom
  geom_rug(aes(color = pos_neg)) +
  # add red and green ribbons
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = perc_chane_pos, group = 1), fill = "green4", alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = perc_chane_neg, ymax = 0, group = 1), fill = "red3", alpha = 0.2) +
  # faceting by year
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  theme_minimal() +
  # use specific breaks
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, breaks = c(-0.6, -0.3, 0, 0.3, 0.6), minor_breaks = c(-0.45, -0.15, 0.15, 0.45)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(13, 26, 39, 53), minor_breaks = c(0, 6.5, 19.5, 32.5, 45.5)) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("red3", "green4")) + # change colors of rugs
  theme(legend.position = "none") + # without legend
  labs(y = "",
       x = "week",
       title = "Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle = "% change from weekly averages \ncalculated between 2015-2019",
       caption = "Source: TfL, London Data Store") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), # changes size of axis labels,
        axis.title = element_text(size = 15), # changes size of axis titles,
        strip.text = element_text(size = 13), # change size of facet titles
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "gray90"), # change color of minor grid
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "gray90"), # change color of major grid
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 15), # change size of plot subtitle
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 12), # change size of plot caption
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18)) # change size of plot title

```
It can be seen from the graph above that the peaks and the troughs of the 2020 graph are much sharper with much less usage this year. This could be due to the government lock downs and the advice to stay home and avoid transport. This year is a major out lier when comparing with the years before. With that said, will the demands pick up like the years before? Many companies are planning on implementing more work from home measures even after the pandemic...
