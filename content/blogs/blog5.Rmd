For this analysis, I have taken a data set on Human Resrouce Analytics from the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset), it is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.  

First We load the libraries for the functions we will need for the analysis.

```
```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) #load libraries
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(vroom)
library(tidyquant)
library(kableExtra)
library(broom)
library(GGally)

library(huxtable)


options(scipen=200)

#load data from csv
hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("data", "datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv"))

```

Next, I will clean the data so that the values are strings with correct names rather than numerical outputs.


```{r}

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% #here we clean the data set and 
  mutate(  
    education = case_when(     
      education == 1 ~ "Below College", #here we assign the number values to strings with                                                 the name of the level of education.
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",#here we assign the number values to strings with                                                 according to level of satisfaction.
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",#here we assign the number values to strings with                                                 according to level of satisfaction.
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",#here we assign the number values to strings with                                                 according to level of satisfaction.
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,#choosing data from original dataset
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)
         
         
         

```


I decided to glimpse the data to gain an overview of the dataset and using the `skim` output, we can see that we are dealing with a nice dataset with no missing values. 

```{r hr_glimpse}
glimpse(hr_cleaned)#glimpse to get a quick overview of the data
skim(hr_cleaned)#make sure the data is free from missing values

```
Next lets try to understand the relationships in our data a little further through plots and analysis.

As we are in the shoes of IBM, talent retention is obviously a very relevant topic for us. 
From the data it can be seen that around 84% of people stay at IBM:

```{r attrition_2}

hr_cleaned %>%
  group_by(attrition) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) %>% # calculate proportion of people who left vs stayed (i.e. by attrition)
  select(attrition, proportion) %>%  # kill counting column (n)
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
  


```

However, it's not only about the mere number, but also about which kind of people leave. If only low performers stay with IBM and all high
achievers are leaving, this would be pretty bad. Thus, lets have a look at `attrition` in combination with `performance_rating`:

```{r attrition_performance}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = attrition, fill = performance_rating)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + # show performance rating proportion by attrition (with bars both at 100%)
  labs(fill = "performance rating",
       y = "proportion",
       title = "Attrition and Performance Rating are Independent",#sets labels
       subtitle = "Performance rating proportion by attrition") +
       theme_bw()#sets theme

```

 The performance of people has no influence on attrition. This is a sign that we are keepin a good portion of our outstanding employees!

Other important factors for a company are the distributions of  `years_at_company`, `monthly_income` and `years_since_last_promotion`. Lets get a visual pospective of these factors using density plots.

Lets start with years at company.

```{r distributions_summary}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = years_at_company)) + 
  geom_density()+ #plot type
  labs(x = "years at company",#the labs function labels parts of the plot
       title = "Majority of the employees stay for 5 years!",
        subtitle = " Distribution of years at company")+
        theme_bw()#setting the theme
       
       
       
```


Next lets look at years since last promotion.
```{r}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = years_since_last_promotion)) + 
  geom_density() + #plot type
 labs(x = "Years since last promotion",#adding labels to the plot
       title = "Employees are promoted quite frequently in IBM!",
        subtitle = " Distribution of years since last promotion")+
        theme_bw()#adding theme
```
We see that big portion of the employees have been promoted in the last 5 years. 


We now want to analyse `job_satisfaction` and `work_life_balance as these are big facctors on employee retention. 
First, lets look at the job satisfaction proportion percentages:

```{r job_sat_wlb}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = factor(job_satisfaction, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High")))) + #levels gives order to the values
  geom_bar(aes(y = stat(prop), group = 1)) + # do not show absolute counts but the proportion in percent (stat(prop))
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + # show y values as percentages
  labs(x = "Job Satisfaction", y= "Proportion per rating", #sets labels
       title = "60% are within the high and very high Job satisfaction!",
       subtitle = " Distribution of years since last promotion")+
       theme_bw() #sets theme
       
       

```

This is great to see for the HR department and explains why most employees spend more than 5 years. However lets look at how the employees feel about the work life balance at IBM.

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = factor(work_life_balance, levels = c("Bad", "Good", "Better", "Best")))) + #levels gives order to the values
  geom_bar(aes(y = stat(prop), group = 1)) + # do not show absolute counts but the proportion in percent (stat(prop))
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + # show y values as percentages
  labs(x = "work-life-balance", y= "Proportions by rating",
       title = "A very small percentage are unhappy",
       subtitle = "Proportion of people by work-life-balance")+
       theme_bw() #sets theme
       
```

We can see that most people (over 60%) are highly satisfied with their job. Furthermore, only around 5% of people have a bad work-life-balance.
Is there any relationship between those two variables? Let's have a look:

```{r job_sat_wlb_2}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = factor(job_satisfaction, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High")), # order job satisfaction properly
                       fill = factor(work_life_balance, levels = c("Best", "Better", "Good", "Bad")))) + # order w-l-b properly
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(fill = "work life balance", #labes graph
       y = "proportion",
       title = "Job Satisfaction and Work Life Balance are independent",
       subtitle = "Work life balance proportion by job satisfaction",
       x = "job satisfaction")+
       theme_bw() #sets theme
```

Hence, it seems like there is no apparent relationship between work-life-balance and job satisfaction!

Other relationships of interest are between monthly income and education and also monthly income and gender.
Let's see what we find out:

```{r relationship_income_edu}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(y = factor(education, levels = c("Below College", "College", "Bachelor", "Master", "Doctor")), #orders education properly
                       x = monthly_income)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "monthly income",
       y = "education",
       title= " There is a slight increase in the medians per degree",
       subtitle = "Monthly income boxplots by education")+#sets labels
       theme_bw()#sets theme

```

In the boxplot above, we can see that the median monthly income is higher with higher education, with the exemption of
a lower median monthly income for a Bachelor education as opposed to College education.


```{r relationship_income_gender}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, mapping = aes(x = monthly_income, y = stat(density))) + # show density, not counts (stat(density))
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(colour = gender)) +
  labs(x = "monthly income",
       title = "monthly income distribution by gender") +
  facet_wrap(~gender)#splits the graphs by gender

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(y = gender, 
                       x = monthly_income)) +
  geom_boxplot() +#type of plot
  labs(x = "monthly income",#sets labels
       y = "gender",
       subtitle = "monthly income boxplots by gender",
       title= "The gender pay gap is not seen?!")+
       theme_bw()#sets theme

```

Despite many articles about the gender pay gap, it seems like women are (slightly) better off than men at IBM!
Even though this is the overall effect, let's take a look at payment by job role. Are both men and women are paid the same in the same job?

```{r gender_pay_job}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(y = gender, 
                       x = monthly_income)) +
  geom_boxplot() +#type of plot
  facet_wrap(~job_role) +#split graph by theme
  labs(x = "monthly income",#labels plot
       y = "gender",
       subtitle = "monthly income boxplots by gender",
       title = "The pay gap is evident in the research director role")

```

In this case, we actually find some evidence for the gender pay gap! As an example, female research directors seem to be paid less as their male colleagues. 

As indicated in the boxplots above, it seems like some job roles are paid much better than others. Hence, let's have a deeper look at the relationship between job role and income.

```{r job_income}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(y = reorder(job_role, monthly_income), x = monthly_income)) + # order by monthly income
  geom_boxplot() +#type of graph
  labs(x = "monthly income",#labels plot
       y = "job role",
       subtitle = "Monthly income boxplots by job role",
       title="Unsurprisingly, managers have the highest income")+
       theme_bw()#sets theme

```

As one would expect, managers get paid the most (on average). Sales representatives are least well paid. What happens when we also bring in age?

```{r age_income_job_role}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = age, y = monthly_income)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + # set opacity of points
  facet_wrap(~job_role) +# one scatterplot for each job role
  geom_smooth()+#adds a smooth line
  labs(y = "monthly income",#labels plot
       title = "Small effect of age on monthly income given job role")+
       theme_bw()#adds a theme


```

Even though the effect of age on monthly income is not too apparent when faceting on job role, we also have to take into account that
one usually takes on other roles throughout a career. This is why overally there still is an effect of age on income:

```{r age_income}

ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x = age, y = monthly_income)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + # set opacity of points
  geom_smooth() +#adds smooth line
  labs(y = "monthly income",#adds labels
       title = "Tendency to have higher income with higher age")+
       theme_bw()#adds a theme

```

After looking into the relationships between the data I decided
to find out if I can make a good prediction (at least 80%) of the monthly income values using a regression model and the other inputs of the data set.

First, I tried to see the if age was an effecitve factor
```{r}
model_1 <- lm(monthly_income ~ age, data = hr_cleaned) #runs regression model on set variables
model_1 %>% broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) #produces table of statistics
model_1 %>% broom::glance()

```


From the table we can see that the age is a significant factor since its t-value is greater than 2. However our result is not very good at guessing the monthly income since the adjusted r-squared value is only 0.248. This means the model gets only a quarter of the results right! 

Lets try to improve our odds!I am going to try to add another input value.
```{r}
model_2 <- lm(monthly_income ~ age+ years_at_company, data = hr_cleaned) #runs regression model on set variables

model_2 %>% broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)#produces table of statistics 
model_2 %>% broom::glance()#produces table of statistics 

```


From the table we can see that the years_at_comapny is also significant factor since its t-value is greater than 2. Although our result has improved, it is still not very good at guessing the monthly income since the adjusted r-squared value is only 0.391. This means the model gets only around 40% right! 

I will add gender to see if it impacts the values from our regression


```{r}
model_4 <- lm(monthly_income ~ age+ years_at_company + gender, data = hr_cleaned) #runs regression model on set variables
model_4 %>% broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)#produces table of statistics 
model_4 %>% broom::glance()#produces table of statistics kbl
```


From the table we can see that the gender does not play a big role in the monthly income in this data! This is because the t-value is 0.316, which is much lower than the required 2 threshold to be significant. This can also be seen since our adjusted r-squared value did not improve.

Lets remove gender since it is not a useful factor and add job role instead.


```{r}
model_4 <- lm(monthly_income ~ age+ years_at_company + job_role, data = hr_cleaned) #runs regression model on set variables
model_4 %>% broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)#produces table of statistics  
model_4 %>% broom::glance()#produces table of statistics 
```


The result is great! Job role plays a huge factor in monthly income, this makes sense and has raised the adjusted r-squared value to approximately 85%! This passes the requirement that I set as my goal!
